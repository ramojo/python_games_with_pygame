# Learning Pygame

This repository contains my journey learning Pygame - a set of Python modules designed for writing video games.

## What is Pygame?

Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning playground where I experiment with:

- Basic game development concepts
- Sprite and graphics handling
- Game physics
- User input management
- Sound integration
- Collision detection
- Animation techniques

## Projects

As I learn, I'll be adding various small games and experiments to practice different Pygame features and concepts.

## Getting Started

To run any of the games in this repository:

1. Ensure you have Python installed
2. Install Pygame: `pip install pygame`
3. Clone this repository
4. Run individual game files using Python

## Game 1: Space Dodger

Almost a space invaders clone (extremely simplified) where you just dodge falling projectiles
